# Claude Development Session Notes

## Project: OnCall Burnout Detector - Railway Deployment & Analysis Fixes

### Recent Major Work Completed

#### 1. UUID Implementation for Unique Analysis URLs ✅
- **Issue**: Analyses used predictable integer IDs, not shareable
- **Solution**: Added UUID field to Analysis model with automatic generation
- **Files Changed**:
  - `backend/app/models/analysis.py` - Added UUID column
  - `backend/app/api/endpoints/analyses.py` - Added UUID endpoints & responses
  - `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use UUIDs in URLs
- **Migration**: Created PostgreSQL migration scripts for Railway
- **Status**: Completed - analyses now have unique shareable URLs

#### 2. Railway PostgreSQL Compatibility Fixes ✅
- **Issue**: SQLAlchemy errors on Railway due to missing UUID column
- **Solution**: Graceful handling of missing columns during migration
- **Files Changed**:
  - `backend/migrate_uuid_step1.py` - Database migration script
  - `backend/app/api/endpoints/analyses.py` - Safe UUID access with getattr()
  - `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fallback to integer IDs
- **Status**: Completed - app works before and after migration

#### 3. Analysis Execution Error Fixes ✅
- **Issue**: Multiple "NoneType to numerator/denominator" errors
- **Solution**: Added None checks to all mathematical operations
- **Files Changed**:
  - `backend/app/services/burnout_analyzer.py` - Fixed division operations
  - `backend/app/core/burnout_analyzer.py` - Added None checks
  - `backend/app/services/unified_burnout_analyzer.py` - Protected calculations
  - `backend/app/agents/tools/*.py` - Added missing logger imports
- **Status**: Completed - analyses run without NoneType errors

#### 4. Burnout Factors Chart Data Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Chart showed all zeros despite hundreds of incidents
- **Solution**: Added missing 'factors' structure to SimpleBurnoutAnalyzer
- **Files Changed**:
  - `backend/app/core/simple_burnout_analyzer.py` - Added factors calculation
- **Status**: Completed - burnout factors now show actual values

#### 5. Historical Analyses Visibility Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Old analyses not showing due to UUID column errors
- **Solution**: Safe UUID field access with proper fallbacks
- **Files Changed**:
  - `backend/app/api/endpoints/analyses.py` - getattr() for safe access
- **Status**: Completed - all historical analyses visible

### CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED - Health Trends Chart Logic ✅

#### Issue Resolution:
The health trends chart was showing historical analysis results instead of daily incident data from the current analysis period.

#### Changes Made:
1. **Backend**: Modified `/analyses/trends/historical` endpoint in `backend/app/api/endpoints/analyses.py`
   - Now returns daily incident trends from the most recent analysis
   - Uses the `daily_trends` data already generated by the burnout analyzer
   - Each data point shows daily incident count, health score, and members at risk
   - Filters by `days_back` parameter for chart display range

2. **Data Structure**: The endpoint now returns:
   - Date for each day with incident data
   - Daily incident count and health scores
   - Members at risk based on incident patterns
   - Health status (critical, at_risk, moderate, healthy)
   - Timeline events for significant health changes

#### Technical Details:
- Uses most recent completed analysis instead of aggregating historical analyses
- Extracts `daily_trends` from analysis results (generated by `_generate_daily_trends`)
- Maintains same API response format for frontend compatibility
- Filters trends by date range specified in `days_back` parameter

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Run backend
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Check database migrations needed on Railway
cd backend && python run_uuid_migration.py

# Debug trends data
cd backend && python debug_trends_data.py
```

### Known Working Features:
- ✅ Analysis creation and execution
- ✅ Burnout factors chart with real data
- ✅ Historical analyses list
- ✅ UUID-based shareable URLs
- ✅ Background analysis processing
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

### Outstanding Issues:
1. Slack channel access errors (bot not in channels) - Low priority
2. Invalid Anthropic API key for AI narratives - User configuration issue

### Recently Completed:
1. ✅ **Health Trends Chart Logic** - Fixed to show daily incident data from current analysis period
