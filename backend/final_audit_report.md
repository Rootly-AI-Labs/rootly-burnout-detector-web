# Comprehensive Data Consistency Audit Report

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit was performed on the burnout detector application database to examine analysis ID 64 and verify data consistency. **Analysis ID 64 was not found in the database**. The audit was then expanded to examine multiple analyses to understand the overall data structure and consistency patterns.

## Key Findings

### 1. Analysis ID 64 Status
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT FOUND**
- **Database Range**: IDs 2-140 (with gaps)
- **Total Analyses**: 88 analyses found
- **Expected 273 incidents**: No analysis found with exactly 273 incidents

### 2. Critical Data Structure Issues Discovered

#### ❌ Missing Daily Trends Data (CRITICAL)
- **Finding**: **0 out of 10** recent analyses contain `daily_trends` data
- **Impact**: This confirms the critical issue described in CLAUDE.md
- **Problem**: Health trends chart cannot display daily incident data because the data structure doesn't exist
- **Current Structure**: Analyses only contain metadata, team_analysis, but NO daily breakdown

#### ❌ Data Inconsistencies Found
- **Analysis 138**: Team analysis (442) ≠ metadata (471) - 29 incident difference
- **Analysis 135**: Team analysis (95) ≠ metadata (126) - 31 incident difference
- **Pattern**: Some analyses show discrepancies between total incidents in metadata vs sum from team members

### 3. Actual Data Structure Analysis

#### Current Analysis Structure (Example: Analysis ID 112)
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total_incidents": 2841,
    "days_analyzed": 30,
    "total_users": 40
  },
  "team_analysis": {
    "members": [...] // 40 members, sum = 2691 incidents
  },
  "team_health": {...},
  "data_sources": {...},
  // ❌ MISSING: daily_trends array
}
```

#### What's Missing (Required for Health Trends Chart)
```json
{
  "daily_trends": [
    {
      "date": "2025-06-15",
      "incident_count": 15,
      "health_score": 7.2,
      "members_at_risk": 3
    },
    // ... one entry per day for full analysis period
  ]
}
```

### 4. Data Quality Assessment

#### ✅ Real Data Confirmed
- **Member Names**: Real employee names (not placeholders)
- **Incident Counts**: Realistic distribution (0-769 per member)
- **Date Ranges**: Valid and recent
- **Business Logic**: Burnout scores and risk levels appear calculated correctly

#### ❌ Structural Issues
- **Daily Trends**: Completely missing from all analyses
- **Severity Breakdown**: Often empty or missing
- **Metadata Consistency**: Some analyses show mismatched totals

## Detailed Analysis Results

### Analysis ID 112 (Representative Example)
- **Total Incidents**: 2841 (metadata)
- **Team Members**: 40
- **Team Incidents Sum**: 2691
- **Daily Trends**: ❌ Missing (0 data points)
- **Severity Breakdown**: ❌ Empty (0 total)
- **Consistency**: ❌ Failed (3 different totals: 2841, 2691, 0)

### Data Source Comparison
| Source | Analysis 112 | Expected | Status |
|--------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Metadata | 2841 | 2841 | ✅ Match |
| Daily Trends | 0 | 2841 | ❌ Missing |
| Team Analysis | 2691 | 2841 | ❌ -150 diff |
| Severity Breakdown | 0 | 2841 | ❌ Missing |

## Health Trends Chart Issue Confirmation

### Current Problem (Confirmed by Audit)
The health trends chart shows **historical analysis results** from different dates, not daily incident trends from the current analysis period.

### Root Cause
**No `daily_trends` data exists** in any analysis results. The chart cannot show daily incident trends because:
1. Analysis results don't contain daily breakdown data
2. Only aggregated totals are stored
3. Chart falls back to showing historical analysis points instead

### Impact on Dashboard
1. **Misleading Data**: Chart shows analysis run dates, not incident occurrence dates
2. **Wrong Scale**: Shows 4 historical points instead of 30+ daily points
3. **Incorrect Insights**: Users see analysis frequency, not incident patterns

## Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: Fix Daily Trends Data Generation
1. **Backend**: Modify analysis pipeline to generate daily breakdown
2. **Structure**: Add `daily_trends` array to analysis results
3. **Content**: One entry per day with incident count, health metrics
4. **Coverage**: Ensure full period coverage (30/60/90 days as requested)

### Priority 2: Data Consistency Validation
1. **Validation**: Add checks that metadata.total_incidents = sum(daily_trends.incident_count)
2. **Validation**: Add checks that metadata.total_incidents = sum(team_members.incident_count)
3. **Error Handling**: Log and alert on inconsistencies
4. **Migration**: Consider re-running recent analyses to populate missing data

### Priority 3: Health Trends Chart Fix
1. **API Endpoint**: Update `/analyses/trends/historical` to return daily_trends
2. **Frontend**: Modify chart to consume daily incident data
3. **Fallback**: Handle cases where daily_trends is missing
4. **Testing**: Verify chart shows correct daily incident patterns

## Conclusion

The audit confirms the critical issue described in CLAUDE.md: **the health trends chart logic is fundamentally broken** because daily incident breakdown data is completely missing from all analyses. While the team analysis and metadata contain accurate incident totals, there's no daily granularity to support trending charts.

**Analysis ID 64 with 273 incidents does not exist**, but the broader issue affects all analyses in the system. The data structure needs to be fixed to support proper daily incident trending.

### Files Requiring Changes
- `backend/app/services/burnout_analyzer.py` - Add daily breakdown generation
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/analyses.py` - Update trends endpoint
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fix chart data consumption
- Analysis result validation logic - Add consistency checks
