# Integration Platform Restoration Summary

## Issue
The user correctly pointed out that the GitHub and Slack integration components were missing from the integrations page. These components existed as separate files but were never integrated into the main integrations page.

## What Was Restored
Based on the investigation:

1. **GitHub Integration Card** - `/frontend/src/components/integrations/github-integration-card.tsx`
   - OAuth and manual token authentication
   - Token validation for GitHub personal access tokens
   - Organization listing and connection testing

2. **Slack Integration Card** - `/frontend/src/components/integrations/slack-integration-card.tsx`
   - OAuth and bot token authentication
   - Workspace and user ID tracking
   - Token validation for Slack bot tokens

3. **Platform Selector** - `/frontend/src/components/integrations/platform-selector.tsx`
   - Unified interface showing all 4 platforms (Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, Slack)
   - Visual grid with connection status indicators
   - Platform descriptions and guidance

## Changes Made to Main Integrations Page

1. **Imports Added**:
   ```tsx
   import { PlatformSelector } from "@/components/integrations/platform-selector"
   import { GitHubIntegrationCard } from "@/components/integrations/github-integration-card"
   import { SlackIntegrationCard } from "@/components/integrations/slack-integration-card"
   ```

2. **State Updates**:
   - Updated `activeTab` type to include "github" | "slack"
   - Updated `addingPlatform` type to include "github" | "slack"
   - Added integration counts for all platforms

3. **Platform Cards Replacement**:
   - Replaced individual Rootly/PagerDuty cards with unified PlatformSelector
   - Added support for all 4 platforms in one component

## Current Status
The LLM token management feature I added is still intact and properly positioned. The integrations page now shows:

1. **Platform Selection** - All 4 platforms (Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, Slack)
2. **LLM Token Configuration** - User token management for AI insights
3. **Integration Forms** - Based on selected platform
4. **Existing Integrations** - Connected integrations display

## Next Steps Needed
The integration is partially complete. To fully restore GitHub/Slack functionality:

1. Add GitHub/Slack integration form sections (currently only Rootly/PagerDuty forms exist)
2. Implement GitHub/Slack integration count logic (currently hardcoded to 0)
3. Add GitHub/Slack to existing integrations display section
4. Test the integration flows end-to-end

This preserves all existing functionality while adding the missing GitHub/Slack components back to the integrations page.
